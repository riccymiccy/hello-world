# hello-world
riccymiccy's first beginnings
This is my first foray into Github and programming. I am studying data science through codecademy at the moment. 
I started on SQL and then move to python, panda, numpy, scipy. 
After completing this route, I plan to go into web development and learn javascipt and ruby.
I hope this makes sense but in 3 months time, I may realise I am complete dufus.
